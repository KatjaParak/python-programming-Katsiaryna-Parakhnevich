## Laboratory 3. Linear classification.

The purpose of this laboratory is to explore the basic idea behind the linear classifier algorithm.
The program uses a linear function y = kx + m in order to classify data from a CSV file into two classes. Classification is based on the function which determine whether the point is left/below or right/above the straight line. Function returns a list of labels (label '0' for points left/below the straight line and label '1' for points right/above the straight line). The program creates then a new CSV file with a new column 'labels'. 

Finally, the program prints out the quantity of points classified as '0' and '1', and turns labelled data into a scatter plot.
